1. Image pre-process (obtain mask)

2. Split connected blocks (obtain [x,y,theta])

3. classify blocks information (obtain [color, shape, letter, reachability])


-> data for CNN training
mannually crop the block data from sample images, classify the cropped
Shape: using neural network
Color: using neural network
Character: using MATLAB built-in function OCR(Optical Character Recognition) to classify letters
Block angle:
  -  shape block:
  - letter block:
